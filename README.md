# webhook-debugger
A very simple request bin for testing your webhooks. Simply spin up this
docker container, point your webooks at the container, and then
view the inbound request contents in the docker console log.

# TODO
show sample output of debugger working


# Getting started
simply run:
```
docker pull unmgmt/webhook-debugger
docker run \
  --name webhook-debugger \
  -d \
  --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  unmgmt/webhook-debugger
```
# Developing
First, you build it:
`make build` or `docker build -t webhook-debugger .`

Then you run it:
`make run` or `docker run -it --rm webhook-debugger`

Default port is 8080
